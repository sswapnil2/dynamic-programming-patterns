# Question
#
#  The goal is to get the maximum profit from the items in the knapsack. Each item can only be selected once, as we donâ€™t have multiple quantities of any item.

#Weights: { 2, 3, 1, 4 }
#Profits: { 4, 5, 3, 7 }
#Knapsack capacity: 5
#
#

# Problem can be solved using two approaches

# 1 recursive approach 

# brute force solution

#  complexity O(2^n)
